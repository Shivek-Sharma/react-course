### Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query
RTK Query is an advanced **data fetching** and **caching** tool, designed to simplify common cases for *loading data* in a web application. RTK Query itself is built on top of the Redux Toolkit core, and leverages RTK's APIs like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` to implement its capabilities.

RTK Query ensures that any component that subscribes to the same query will always use the same data.
