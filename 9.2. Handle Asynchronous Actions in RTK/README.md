### Thunk
The Redux Toolkit Thunk is a middleware for the Redux library that allows you to write asynchronous logic that interacts with the store. It is designed to make it easier to work with asynchronous actions in Redux.

The thunk can also be used to perform conditional logic, such as dispatching a different action depending on the result of the async operation.

It generates three standardized action types for you: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. These action types help manage the state of asynchronous operations in your Redux store.
